# DoubleEpicList
Created for a very specific situation.  Client was using SAFe with quarterly Planning Increments.   Epics were designated as being either 'discovery' or 'delivery' and were assigned to the release trains using tags.  It was necessary to create a user-friendly view that would allow users to clearly see the epics underway for their train in a given quarter.
